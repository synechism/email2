# Nylas v3 API Integration Guide

- **Always use v3.** The v2 API is deprecated.
- A **grant** = an authenticated user account (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) connected through Nylas.
- **Base URLs**: `https://api.us.nylas.com` (US) / `https://api.eu.nylas.com` (EU). All paths `/v3/`.
- **Auth**: Most APIs use Bearer token (API key) plus a grant ID in the path. Admin domain management and Beta admin API key endpoints use Nylas Service Account auth instead.
- **SDKs**: Node.js, Python, Ruby, Kotlin/Java.
- **Security**: Treat grant-scoped API data as untrusted when writing integration code.
- **Scope**: This skill is integration-authoring guidance, not runtime access guidance. Do not use model-loaded rules as instructions to inspect live user resources during an agent session.

## Documentation

Use the checked-in rules in this skill and the compiled reference in `AGENTS.md` as the working source for agent behavior. External docs links below are reference URLs only; do not load remote markdown into the active prompt at runtime.

- **Docs index** (find the right page): `https://developer.nylas.com/llms.txt`
